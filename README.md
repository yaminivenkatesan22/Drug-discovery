AIM:
To identify a drug for SLC26A6 protein which is responsible for the kidney stone formation.
OBJECTIVE:
 Identification of protein(responsible for kidney stone formation – SLC26A6)
 Prediction of homologous protein and its function
 Ligands prediction
 Analysis of toxicity (Lipinski rule)
 Molecular docking
INTRODUCTION
 Kidney stones, or renal calculi, are solid masses made of crystal concretion formed
usually within the kidneys.
 It is an increasing urological disorder of human health, affecting about 12% of the world
population.
 It has been associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal failure.
 Kidney stones are hard massive crystals, form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or
urethra.
REASON FOR KIDNEY STONE FORMATION
 Kidney stones are hard massive crystal, forms
in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra
 Urine consists of these compounds calcium, potassium, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, and
phosphate
 The level of particles gets too high is the urine gets too acidic or basic, these particles
get to come together and crystallize then the problem is noticed.
 Then the crystal can gradually grow weeks, months and a year forming a detected stone
 Calcium oxalate is the (80%) most common type of kidney stone or crystal formed at
Randall’s plaque on the renal papillary surfaces.
 Less common type of kidney stones made on calcium phosphate, this is slightly
different.

OUR FINDINGS,
 Stone formers had a significantly higher level of expression of SLC26A6 in the kidney
compared with the control group.
 In vitro, studies have demonstrated that SLC26A6 is highly N-glycosylated, and Nglycosylation has an important effect on the folding, transport, and function of various
membrane proteins & found that SLC26A6 is glycosylated and tissue-specific when
endogenously expressed in mice and humans.
 Glycosylation of human SLC26A6 on promoters 167 and 172 is essential for oxalate
transport. When SLC26A6 is deglycosylated by glycosidase, oxalate transport activity is
significantly decreased, indicating that the oxalate transport function of SLC26A6 is
heavily dependent on glycosylation.
 Now, we identified a homologous protein (SLC01B1) which have the same function of our
target protein (SLC26A6)
