AIM:
To identify a drug for SLC26A6 protein which is responsible for kidney stone formation.

OBJECTIVE:
Identification of protein(responsible for kidney stone formation – SLC26A6),
Prediction of homologous protein and its function,
Ligands prediction,
Analysis of toxicity (Lipinski rule),
Molecular docking,

Reason for kidney stone formation: 
Kidney stones are hard massive crystals, that form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine consists of these compounds calcium, potassium, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, and phosphate. The level of particles gets too high if the urine gets too acidic or basic, these particles come together and crystallize then the problem is noticed.Then the crystal can gradually grow weeks, months and a year forming a detected stone Calcium oxalate is the (80%) most common type of kidney stone or crystal formed at Randall’s plaque on the renal papillary surfaces. Less common type of kidney stones made on calcium phosphate, but this is slightly different.

OUR FINDING :
Stone formers had a significantly higher level of expression of SLC26A6 in the kidney
compared with the control group.
In vitro, studies have demonstrated that SLC26A6 is highly N-glycosylated, and N-glycosylation has an important effect on the folding, transport, and function of various
membrane proteins & found that SLC26A6 is glycosylated and tissue-specific when
endogenously expressed in mice and humans.
Glycosylation of human SLC26A6 on promoters 167 and 172 is essential for oxalate
transport. When SLC26A6 is deglycosylated by glycosidase, oxalate transport activity is
significantly decreased, indicating that the oxalate transport function of SLC26A6 is
heavily dependent on glycosylation.
Now, we identified a homologous protein (SLC01B1) which have the same function as our
target protein (SLC26A6).
A binding energy of -11.3 kcal/mol indicates a highly favorable and strong interaction
between the protein and ligand in our drug design study. Binding energy represents the
thermodynamic stability of the protein-ligand complex, and a lower (more negative) value
suggests a more stable interaction. In this case, the negative sign indicates that energy is
released during the binding process, highlighting the exothermic nature of the interaction.
